# Discord Ultracompact Theme
A compact theme optimized for small windows.

This theme is intended to be used on small windows and may be shitty on big ones.
It is compatible with any style mode (light, dark, cosy or compact).
Later you'll be able to choose a resolution breakpoint so big windows will keep displaying your default theme.
